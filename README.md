# restaurant_management_system

---

## summary

This program is the homework in NEU. To submit my homework, I code it in 2 days. So it's simple. There exist sooooo many deficiencies. In addition, if you are also a student in NEU and want to **copy one** for homework on GitHub, **please ignore my code**, as there is a **duplicate checking mechanism**.

## environment

The program is developed with visual studio in Windows X64. If you use linux, there may be errors. To better view the program, you can open **information_management_system.sln** with VisualStudio.

## **ATTENTION**

 After running the executable file, the program will ask you to input an account ant the password to it. **The account and password are both "test"**.
